## 1. CK Survivors Code of Conduct

CK Survivors is a community of entrepreneurs who are former members of Traffic & Funnels' Client Kit coaching program. It is a place where members can continue to enjoy the best part of the CK environment - the people. Anyone willing to invest $10,000 is serious about growing their business, and we've all earned the right to continue to work together and support one another without paying for the privelege. 

We adhere to the following Community Standards:

 * CK Survivors are genuine and kind. Be open. Be you. Our community is accepting, judgment-free and kind.

 * CK Survivors ask for help. We are all here to because we need help with something - growth, management, or perhaps just needing a friend.

 * CK Survivors lead with a giving hand, pay it forward & give help generously. One of the things that separates us from other communities is generosity. Our members should give to and help one another without ever asking for anything in return. Coincidentally - that mindset is also what leads to the most growth.

 * CK Survivors Show Class. We don't blatantly pitch or sell. Organically, you will likely pick up some clients, partnerships or contractors that will help grow your business from CKS. However, we discourage posts or unsolicited direct messages that blatantly sell your product or service. Those kinds of posts hurt the giving environment we've created.


## 2. Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

  * Participate in an authentic and active way. In doing so, you contribute to the health and longevity of this community.
  * Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
  * Attempt collaboration before conflict.
  * Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
  * Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants. Alert community leaders if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this Code of Conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.
  * Remember that community event venues may be shared with members of the public; please be respectful to all patrons of these locations.


## 3. Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

  * Violence, threats of violence or violent language directed against another person.
  * Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
  * Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
  * Posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifying information ("doxing").
  * Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
  * Inappropriate photography or recording.
  * Inappropriate physical contact. You should have someone's consent before touching them.
  * Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes, sexualized comments or jokes; inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcomed sexual advances.
  * Deliberate intimidation, stalking or following (online or in person).
  * Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
  * Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.


## 4. Consequences of Unacceptable Behavior

Unacceptable behavior from any community member, including sponsors and those with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case of a paid event).
